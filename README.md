# Scenario
You are working as an analyst for a real estate company. Your company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.

# Objective
To build a model that will predict the price of a house based on features provided in the dataset. Senior management also wants to explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tools. One of those parameters includes understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above.

# Variables-description
Id: Unique identification number for the property
date: the date the house was sold
price: the price of the house
waterfront: the house which has a view to a waterfront
condition: How good the condition is (Overall). 1 indicates worn-out property and 5 excellent.
grade: Overall grade given to the housing unit, based on the King County grading system. 1 poor, 13 excellent.
Sqft_above: square footage of house apart from the basement
Sqft_living15: Living room area in 2015(implies-- some renovations) This might or might not have affected the lotSize area.
Sqft_lot15: lotSize area in 2015(implies-- some renovations)

# Steps

# 1. Explore the data
To explore the data, you can use the techniques that have been discussed in class. Some of them include using the describe method, checking null values, using Matplotlib and Seaborn for developing visualizations.

The data has many categorical and numerical variables. Explore the nature of data for these variables before you start with the data cleaning process and then data pre-processing (scaling numerical variables and encoding categorical variables).

# 2. Build a Model
Use different models to compare the accuracies and find the model that best fits your data. You can use the measures of accuracies that have been discussed in class. Please note that while comparing different models, make sure you use the same measure of accuracy as a benchmark.

# 3. Visualize
You will use Tableau to visually explore the data further. The questions have been provided in this file.
